# Amazon_music_clustering
A unsupervised machine learning projet based on clustering
# 🎵 Amazon Music Clustering & Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

Music streaming platforms like **Amazon Music** contain millions of songs, making manual genre or mood classification impractical.
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** to automatically cluster songs based on **audio features** and build a **content-based song recommendation system**.

Songs are grouped using **K-Means clustering**, and recommendations are generated by identifying acoustically similar songs within the same cluster.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Cluster songs based on audio characteristics
* Discover hidden musical patterns without labels
* Interpret clusters using genre and artist metadata
* Build an interactive **Streamlit application**
* Implement a **content-based recommendation system**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 🔹 Learning Type

**Unsupervised Learning – Clustering**

### 🔹 Algorithm Used

* **K-Means Clustering**

### 🔹 Why K-Means?

* Efficient for large datasets (~96K songs)
* Works well with continuous numeric features
* Produces interpretable clusters
* Suitable for recommendation systems

## 📂 Dataset Description

### 🎼 Audio Features Used

* `duration_ms`
* `danceability`
* `energy`
* `loudness`
* `speechiness`
* `acousticness`
* `instrumentalness`
* `liveness`
* `valence`
* `tempo`

### 🏷 Metadata (Used After Clustering)

* `genres`
* `name_artists`
* `name_song`

> ⚠️ Genre and artist information were **not used during clustering** to avoid label leakage.
> They were used only for **post-clustering validation and interpretation**.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
4. Cluster selection using:

   * Elbow Method
   * Silhouette Score
   * Davies–Bouldin Index
5. Final clustering using **k = 4**
6. Cluster interpretation using audio features
7. PCA for visualization only
8. Song recommendation system
9. Streamlit deployment

## 📊 Model Evaluation

| Metric               | Value    | Interpretation                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| Silhouette Score     | ~0.23    | Good separation for music data |
| Davies–Bouldin Index | ~1.54    | Acceptable cluster compactness |
| Cluster Balance      | 8% – 48% | Healthy distribution           |

## 🎵 Final Cluster Interpretation (k = 4)

| Cluster | Size | Label                | Description                    |
| ------- | ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0       | ~8%  | Instrumental / Focus | Instrument-heavy, low energy   |
| 1       | ~48% | Party / Energetic    | High energy, danceable, upbeat |
| 2       | ~13% | Rap / Spoken         | Very high speechiness          |
| 3       | ~30% | Chill / Acoustic     | Calm, soft, acoustic music     |

## 🎧 Recommendation System Logic

* Songs are recommended based on **cluster membership**
* Songs within the same cluster share similar audio properties
* Recommendations are ranked using **cosine similarity**
* This is a **content-based recommendation system**
